 measure the current/voltage (Power) to get actual power consumed by load
 
 One of the application im working on needs three phase power measurement to be done through micro-controller. The power measurement is in the range of **90kVA**.
Is there any way to noninvasively/invasively measure the current/voltage to get actual power consumed by load(compressor in this case).

The requirement is to design a Power consumption measurement sensor with IoT to challenge or compare the on board panel which also shows power consumed by Load.

While referring to some material I did came across some methods as **Abraham electrostatic voltmeter** or **Transformer ratio method** and some other for voltage measurement.

But need to understand which method is used in commercial measuring instruments.
